# Assignment 2: Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning

## Instructions

In the `main.py` file, you will find the same code that we discussed in our class on the minimax algorithm.

Your task is to implement the alpha-beta pruning algorithm by completing the `minimax_ab` function.

## Testing 
Run the tests in the file `test_main` to test your implementation before submitting it.
